<h4 class="h4gold">AUDIENCE</h4>
Our intended users are individuals interested in learning how to code, with the ability to motivate and pace themselves. More advanced users will likely not find this resource useful.

<h4 class="h4gold">PREREQUISITES</h4>
In general, the questions in Pythons and Ladders assume the user has a basic knowledge of elementary algebra and mathematics.

<h4 class="h4gold">USAGE</h4>
Powered by the Python emulator from <a href="http://www.skulpt.org" target="_blank">Skulpt.org</a>, Pythons and Ladders guides you through a sequence of squares, each containing a task. Your task is to complete each square, each more difficult than the preceding one, until you reach the end. Along the way, you will encounter some "Python" squares, and some "Ladder" squares, representing easier and harder versions of your current task. Use these alternative versions to help consolidate your learning.
