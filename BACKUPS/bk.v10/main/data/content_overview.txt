<h4 class="h4gold">AUDIENCE</h4>
The intended users of Pythons and Ladders are individuals interested in learning how to code, with the ability to motivate and pace themselves. More advanced users will likely not find this resource useful.

<h4 class="h4gold">PREREQUISITES</h4>
In general, the questions in Pythons and Ladders assume the user has a basic knowledge of elementary algebra and mathematics, as well as an Internet connection.

<h4 class="h4gold">USAGE</h4>
Powered by the Python emulator from <a href="http://www.skulpt.org" target="_blank">Skulpt.org</a>, Pythons and Ladders guides you through a sequence of squares, each containing a puzzle. Your task is to complete each square, each more difficult than the preceding one, until you reach the end. Along the way, you will encounter some "Python" squares, and some "Ladder" squares. Follow the instructions in each square when encountered.

<h4 class="h4gold">OBJECTIVE</h4>
Pythons and Ladders has been developed with the belief that education should be fun, free, and accessible to all. In a world where the ability to design algorithms is evolving into a necessity rather than an advantage, we aspire to provide users the opportunity to learn introductory programming concepts in a structured and interesting way.

We are always open to suggestions and feedback. Whether you use Pythons and Ladders to learn programming from scratch, for a quick refresher, or as an educational resource, we hope it serves you well.

One of the most important skills you can develop as a programmer is your ability to ask and query the right questions.

The following resources tend to have most of the answers: <p><a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">StackOverflow.com</a> &#8212; Every Python question you'll ever think of has been asked and answered here.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/" target="_blank">Python web documentation</a> &#8212; Although many things will fly over your head here, try to study the usage-case examples.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008" target="_blank">PEP 008: Style guide in Python</a> &#8212; Provides guidelines on how to keep your code clean, simple, and quintessentially "Python."</p>
