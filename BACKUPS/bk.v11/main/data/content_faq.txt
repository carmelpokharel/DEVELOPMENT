Q: Which version of Python is used in Pythons and Ladders?
<p>Pythons and Ladders makes use of the Python emulator from <a href="http://www.skulpt.org" target="_blank">Skulpt.org</a>, whose currently known supported version is Python 2.6+ (2016).
Q: How can I install and set up Python on my computer?
<p>You don't need to; all puzzles can be completed in-browser! However, if you're looking to go the extra mile, <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download" target="_blank">here's a link</a> which guides you through the setup process. As far as editors go, we recommend <a href="http://www.wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101" target="_blank">Wing IDE 101</a> if you've never coded before, and in all other cases, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>.
Q: When can I expect to complete Pythons and Ladders?
<p>For a beginner, the completion time is intended to be between a week to two months. This, of course, is proportional to individual activity and engagement levels.
Q: How difficult is programming?
<p>Learning to code isn't particularly easy. Compare it to learning another language, like Spanish. Even though most of the alphabet is the same and there are plenty of overlapping words, a native English speaker will still need to put in a considerable amount of effort to be able to communicate in Spanish.
Q: Is Pythons and Ladders a substitute for formal education?
<p>In short, no. For the sake of comparison, Pythons and Ladders covers roughly the same amount of material as the first four weeks of a first-year university course. The same material is presented here in a more self-paced and tiered manner, reducing the slope of the introductory learning curve, and not the curve itself.
Q: How does Pythons and Ladders differ from other e-Learning tools?
<p>Fundamentally, Pythons and Ladders is a DIY approach to coding, falling under the broad umbrella of e-Learning platforms.<p>When conceiving the original concept, we debated the necessity of developing this resource when so many others existed. Drawing from conversations and research over the following months, we eventually compiled a list of issues common in alternate services:<ul><li class="normal">Lack of focus on problem-solving methods, search engine querying skills, and programming as it relates to everyday life<li class="normal">Developed or taught by enthusiasts/academics unfamiliar with industry practices, resulting in a learning curve far too steep for absolute beginners<li class="normal">Overloaded interfaces, neglecting mobile support and optimizations for slower connections<li class="normal">Quality content available only for a fee/subscription, with the "free" or "demo" packages offering inconclusive material</ul><p>With these insights, we kicked Pythons and Ladders into gear, working on a design intended to address them.
