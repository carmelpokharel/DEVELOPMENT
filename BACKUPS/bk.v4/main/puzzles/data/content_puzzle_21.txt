<b>Substring</b> is a word used to refer to a "piece" of a string. For example, "gym" is a substring of "gymnastics", "ain" is a substring of "paint", and "P" is a substring of "Python". A substring can be any piece of a string, and of any length.

Try the following to see how you can access a single letter from an existing string:
<code class="demo">print "computer"[2]</code>
<code class="demo">print "computer"[5]</code>
This concept of accessing a substring from a string can be applied to variables as well.

Write three lines of code that does the following:
<table>
   <tr>
      <td width="15%" valign="top"><u>Line 1:</u>  </td>
      <td>Create a variable called <em>plant</em> that equals to the string "bonsai tree"</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td width="15%" valign="top"><u>Line 2:</u>  </td>
      <td>Print the substring "b" from the variable</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td width="15%" valign="top"><u>Line 3:</u>  </td>
      <td>Prints the substring " " (the space) from the variable</td>
   </tr>
</table>

Lines 2 and 3 should only reference the variable and NOT the string.

$RIGHTPANEL_QUESTIONS$
Why did <em>print "computer"[2]</em> return the substring ',' and not 'o'?
Why did <em>print "computer"[5]</em> return the substring 't' and not 'u'?
How would you access the substring 'c' (first letter) in the string 'computer'?
What is the largest number you can enclose in the square brackets? Why do you think <em>print "computer"[8]</em> won't work?
When accessing a substring from a variable, do you have to enclose the variable in quotation marks?
