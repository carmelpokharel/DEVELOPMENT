To access an element in a list, we use a concept called indexes. Each element in a Python list is assigned an index. These indices start at 0, and increment with each subsequent element.

In the list ['2', '4', '3', '1', '5'], the element at index 4 is '5'.

To grab the element at a particular index, we use square brackets at the end of the list, and include the index we'd like to read (see examples in the 
editor). We can also grab multiple elements from a list at once, and determine its length using the built-in Python function len().

Write a single-line statement that prints the last element of a givenlist. The list may be of any length. If the list is empty, return the string 'N/A'. Test your code on the following cases:
[]
['1']
[1,4,6,1,5,6]

For example, if you are testing on the list [1,4,5], your code should output should output exactly the following:
&#9656; The last element is: 5

exampleList = ['2', '4', '3', '1', '5']
print exampleList[4]
print ['a', 'b', 'c'][1]
print exampleList[2:4]
print exampleList[:4]
print exampleList[2:]
print len(exampleList)
print len(exampleList[2:])

There's another built-in function in Python called .pop(). Check out how it's used. Can you solve this square using .pop?
How would you access an element of a list that's enclosed in a list? In other words, how would you print "Ladders" from the list below?<br>list1 = [1, 2, ['a', 'b'], ['Pythons', 'and', 'Ladders']]
If you initialize an element, then append another element to it, does the length of the list change?
There is another way to add data to a list, called extend. What is the difference in output between the following two statements?<br>list1 = [1,2,3]<br>print list1.append([7,6])<br>list.extend([7,6])
