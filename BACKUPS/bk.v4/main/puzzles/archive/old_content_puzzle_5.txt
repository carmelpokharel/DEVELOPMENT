A Boolean is a data type which is either True or False. Note that a Boolean is not a string of the words "True" and "False", but its own data type.

To obtain Booleans, we can perform comparison operations, such as greater than, less than, or equal to.

Run the sample code embedded in the editor, and analyze the output at the bottom. Now, write 3 print statements which print the comparisons of two numbers.

For example, if your first number is 1.0, and your second number is 1, your statements should output exactly the following 3 separate lines:
&#9656; Equality comparison:     True
&#9656; Less than comparison:    False
&#9656; Greater than comparison: False

# Remember to test your code thoroughly on a variety of inputs!
num1 = 5.5
num2 = 5
# Comparison operators
print 'Examples:'
print num1 == num2, num1 >= num2, num1 <= num2, num1 > num2, num1 < num2, num1 != num2

How is the double equal sign "==" different from a single "=" one?
What is the "!=" comparison operator?
What would be the result of using a comparison operator on two strings?<br>Try it on "string1 == string1"
Can a string be greater than or less than another string?<br>Try it on "batman" > "Batman"<br>What does the above result mean? (Hint: look into ASCII values)
