Here's the basic construct of an if/else statement:

if (conditional statement is True):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do something
else:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do something else

Recall from the previous lesson that a conditional statement always returns a Boolean value: True, or False.

Run the sample code embedded in the editor, and analyze the output at the bottom. Now, rewrite the if/else statement so that it does the exact same thing, but uses "!=" as the comparison operator (and not "==").

Remember: we are naming our variable newSum, because we don't know if Python has a built-in keyword or function named "sum"... we don't want any conflicts!

# Remember to test your code thoroughly on a variety of inputs!
num1 = 10
num2 = 15.4

if ((num1 + num2) == 25.4):		# Will only execute if (num1 + num2) == 25.4 is True
	newSum = 25.4			# Initializes a new variable, and gives it a value
else:							# Comes here if (num1 + num2) == 25.4 is False
	newSum = num1 + num2	# Initializes a new variable, and gives it a value
print "The sum is " + str(newSum)

What if you want to do something "if it's True", but do nothing "if it's False"?<br>Can an if statement exist without an else statement?
Can an else statement exist without an if statement?
What if, in the editor's else statement, we changed "print firstNum + secondNum" to "newSum = firstNum + secondNum"? What would go wrong?
In the editor's print statement, why does the following code not work?<br>print "The new sum is " + newSum
What's the difference between these two statements?<br>print "The new sum is " + str(newSum)<br>print "The new sum is ", str(newSum)
