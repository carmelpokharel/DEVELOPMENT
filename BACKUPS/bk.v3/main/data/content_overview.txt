Pythons and Ladders is a free, interactive web-based game for anyone new to programming.

<h4 class="h4gold">AUDIENCE</h4>
The ideal user of Pythons and Ladders is someone absolutely new to programming. More advanced users will likely not find this tutorial useful.

<h4 class="h4gold">PREREQUISITES</h4>
All questions in Pythons and Ladders assume the user has a basic knowlege of elementary algebra, and is comfortable using a computer.

<h4 class="h4gold">GAMEPLAY</h4>
Inspired by the popular board game Snakes and Ladders, Pythons and Ladders guides you through a sequence of squares, each containing a puzzle. Your task is to complete each square, each more difficult than the last, until you reach the end. Along the way, you will encounter some "ladder" squares and some "python" squares. Follow the instructions in each square when encountered.

<h4 class="h4gold">OBJECTIVE</h4>
Ideally, upon completion of Pythons and Ladders, you will have developed an interest in programming, and be equipped with problem-solving skills related to coding. Our aim is to get you familiar enough with Python so that when you look to advance your programming skills, you will not be overwhelmed by the resources available on the web.

With that said, we believe programming is for everyone of all ages, in all industries. With Pythons and Ladders, we hope to take a small step in initiating the interested.

One of the most important skills you can develop as a programmer is your ability to ask the right questions. In particular, ask Google the right questions. 

In order to mimic the real world of programming, the puzzles in Pythons and Ladders are designed to encourage you to research important concepts on your own, and use them in your solutions.
