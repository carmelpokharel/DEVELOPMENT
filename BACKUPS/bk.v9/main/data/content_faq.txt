Q: When can I expect to complete Pythons and Ladders?

Q: How can I install and set up Python on my computer?
<p>Here's a link which guides you through the setup process. As far as editors go, we recommend Wing IDE 101 if you've never coded before, and in all other cases, Sublime Text.
Q: How can Python be relevant to my everyday work and lifestyle?
<p>We've attempted to cover real-world use cases in the last few squares of Pythons and Ladders, but here's an article which answers this question far better than we can.
Q: Why is nothing happening when I run my code?
<p>The absence of error messages in the output box is a current limitation in emulator technology. Please see <a href="./main/tutorials/pages/tutorial_8.html">this page</a> of the Tutorial for more information, or install Python on your local machine.
Q: Why can't I use the tab key to indent code in my Editor?
<p>While we figure out a solution, try using spaces instead! When it comes to indentation, either 2 or 4 spaces are best. Whichever you pick, remember to stay consistent.
