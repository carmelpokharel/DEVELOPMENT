A list is yet another data type in Python.

If we continue to think of a variable as a box, a list in Python could be thought of
as a shelf, carrying items. Some of the items may be boxes. If we have a big enough 
box, we can also store a shelf inside it, and that's basically how you initialize a 
variable to store a list in Python.

A Python list is enclosed in square brackets, with each element separated by a comma:
newVariable = [content0, content1, content2]

Run the sample code embedded in the editor, and analyze the output at the bottom.
Now, write Python code that initializes 5 variables containing different elements, 
and adds them to a list IF they are not already in the list. Then, output the list, 
which should now only contain unique values.

For example, if your elements are 5, '6', 6, 4, and 5, your code should output
should output exactly the following:
&#9656; Unique list: [5, '6', 6, 4]

var1 = 5
var2 = 7
# Here are a few ways to declare lists
list1 = []				# Empty list
list2 = [1, 2, 3]			# List of int
list3 = ['1', '2', '3']		# List of str
list4 = [var1, var2]		# List of variables (which could be storing any data type!)
print 8 in list4			# Check if a list contains a particular element
list4.append('tail')		# Adds an element to the end of a list
print list4

$RIGHTPANEL_QUESTIONS$
Since a list is a data type, can you store lists inside a list? In other words, is the following line legal? Try it out!<br>list1 = [2, 4.5, 'Hello!', [1, 2]]
Once you have initialized a variable, can you change the type of data it contains? In other words, can you do this?<br>list1 = [1, 2, 3]<br>list1 = 5
Can you initialize a variable to have no value?<br>(Hint: check out the None data type)
