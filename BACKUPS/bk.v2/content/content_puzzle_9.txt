So far, you've encountered four different built-in Python functions, which
take in inputs, and magically output things you want: isinstance(), int(),
str(), and len(). Now, what if you want to write your own function? You can!

def myFunction(input1, input2):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do something
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return something

Run the sample code embedded in the editor, and analyze how the function
generates the output at the bottom.

Now, rewrite your solution to SQ. 2 by defining a function threeWords(), which
takes in 3 strings as inputs, and returns them as one string, separated by
spaces. Make sure to test your function with these strings as inputs, too:
var1 = '', var2 = '', var3 = ''

For example, if you print threeWords('Life', 'is', 'good!'), your output should be:
&#9656; Life is good!

Note: If the output string has an extra space at the end, it is considered incorrect.

# Consider the example of a function below, which multiplies two numbers:
def multiplyTwoNumbers(num1, num2):
	numProduct = num1 * num2
	return numProduct

# To use the function, you need to call it.
multiplyTwoNumbers(4, 3)

# And in order to see what the function outputs, you need to print it.
print multiplyTwoNumbers(5, 6)
print multiplyTwoNumbers(5.1, 7.2)

$RIGHTPANEL_QUESTIONS$
Why is there no output when you call your function without a print statement?<br>Does calling the built-in functions without printing them result in the same thing?
What if you unknowingly tried to call threeWords() with numbers as inputs? How would you update your function to take care of this case? In other words:<br>print threeWords('Life', 2, 'good')
Can you store the output of your function in a variable? If the following code is valid, could you do something similar with threeWords()?:<br>lengthOfList = len(list1)<br>print lengthOfList
What happens if you try to call multiplyTwoNumbers() with no inputs? Try running this code in your offline editor!
