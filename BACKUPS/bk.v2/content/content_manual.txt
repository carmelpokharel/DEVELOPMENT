A lot of times when discussing programming with our friends, we noticed an underlying 
notion of "you must be quite intelligent!" or "the nerdy things."

There are plenty of resources on the web which go much more in-depth, and are much more 
intuitive to use when it comes to learning Python. They're perfect for a beginner. 
But what if you're not even a beginner? 

What if you've never coded before? What if all those resources overwhelm you within 
5 minutes of browsing? What if you want to become a beginner? That's where Python and
Ladders identifies its niche.

Makes it easy to understand and learn, without it being "for kids." Assumes some 
knowledge of mathematics and computer usage.

A lot of times in learning, we identify the following sequence of acquiring skills:
Beginner --> Amateur --> Professional --> Expert --> Master

Given the rapid pace of technological advancement however, it is no surprise that the 
"beginner" category is becoming more and more difficult to achieve. Pythons and Ladders 
aims to change that flowchart in the following manner:

The ideal person completing these questions, of course, will be proactive. It is hard 
to complete 100 questions using a programming language if you are not devoted to 
learning.

$LEFTPANEL_OBJECTIVE$
How can this help you?
	- Have a quick idea at work to interface Excel
	- Project manager for whom technical details regularly fly over your head
	- Really interested in programming, but have no idea how coding can improve your 
	business

AIMS TO DEVELOP YOUR QUERY SKILLS, since this is what it's like in the real world.
Many concepts won't be explictly listed, but the questions should prompt you to
discover them on your own, and use them in your solutions.

Pythons and Ladders aims to get you familiar enough with common programming concepts 
so that when you are looking to finally advance your programming skills, you will not 
be overwhelmed. The web will not turn you away, and all the resources will become much 
more familiar to you. 

Programming is for everyone, and for all ages. We hope to take a step in making it 
more familiar to everyone.

One of the most important skills you can develop as a programmer is your 
ability to ask the right questions. In particular, ask Google the right 
questions. 

Over the course of this game, Google will send you over to the following
 websites time and again. They're some of our favourites:

	- Stack Overflow
	- Python web documentation
		○ Date formatting: strftime
		○ Date formatting: strptime
	- PEP 008
